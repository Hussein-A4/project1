            Volleyball is played on a court divided into two sides by a net,
            with six players on each of the two teams. The objective in volleyball
            is to send the ball over the net so that the other side canâ€™t return it.
            Each team has three attempts to hit the ball over the net. When a serve
            is hit by the server over the net to the opposing team the ball is put
            into play. If the receiving team wins the rally, they get the chance 
            to serve, and the players on their team rotate clockwise once. If the 
            serving team wins the rally, they win a point and serve again. The ball 
            must clear the net on the serve, and the players play up to 25 or 15 points per set.

        <div class="text">
            Like any other sports, there are rules that need to be followed.
                  <ol style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> 
                      <li>The game must start with a serve from the side that has won a 
                      point(if starting from 0-0 doesnt matter which side starts)</li>
                      <li>
                              The team receiving the ball is allowed 3 hits, those being 
                          either a bump, a set, or a spike. Using the 3 hits, the goal is to
                          get the ball over the net. If more then 3 hits are used the play is over 
                          and whoever wins the point serves again.
                      </li>
                      <li>When breaking the enemy teams streak, your team will serve and rotate clockwise</li>
                  </ol>
        </div>

            Volleyball is a very competitive and difficult sport, and I enjoy sports
            that have a challenge to them. Having a challenge always motivates me to
            practice and improve. Playing volleyball can help improve a lot of skills,
            including movement, learn to serve, pass, and spike the ball. Volleyball can
            also improve communication skills when having to work with teamates. The sport is 
            very unique compared to other sports. There are many variables that need to be taken 
            into consideration making the sport hard and challenging. Overall the sport can be very fun espcially
            when you learn more about it.
